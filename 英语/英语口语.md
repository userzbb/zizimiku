# 1.What Impresses Me Most in University
College life is filled with unforgettable memories, but there is one thing that leaves a deep impression on me. It was the day when our class participated in a voluntary community service to help the elderly in a nursing home.

Upon arriving at the nursing home, we were warmly welcomed by the staff and the residents. As planned, we first chatted with the elderly, listening to their life stories. Furthermore, our class put on some song and dance performances, which was the highlight of our visit. Most importantly, the scene was full of joy and warm atmosphere as everyone enjoyed the performances.

In conclusion, our community service trip not only showed me the power of kindness but also profoundly shaped my outlook on life.

# 2.The Developments in My Hometown
My hometown, a small town among the foothills of Qinling Mountains, has undergone significant changes in recent years. As a student away from home, I am excited to share these developments with you.

On the one hand, one of the most remarkable changes is the growing
infrastructure. New roads, bridges and public facilities have been constructed, which has significantly improved the transportation and living standards of the town.

# 3.University sports facilities should be open to the public
I firmly believe that university sports facilities should be open to the public. The reasons are as follows.

Firstly, this arrangement can greatly enhance the utilization rate of the facilities,reducing waste and ensuring they serve a wider range of community members.Secondly, it could serve as a bridge between the university and the community,fostering stronger ties and promoting mutual understanding. 

Additionally, opening up the facilities to the public could generate additional revenue for the university, which could then be invested in further improving the quality of the facilities. However, it's crucial to ensure that the facilities remain safe and functional, with proper management and maintenance. Moreover, appropriate scheduling should be implemented to avoid any conflicts between students' and the public's use.

Overall, opening university sports facilities to the public is a beneficial move that can bring multiple benefits to both the university and the community.

# 4.On Interpersonal Relationships
Establishing and maintaining good interpersonal relationships is crucial for our lifelong success. how can we build warm and friendly interpersonal relationships on campus?

The following principles might be of great significance. First of all, show empathy. In the face of challenges, or even conflicts in interpersonal interaction, we need to learn to get along with classmates with an inclusive and considerate mind.Besides, be honest and trustworthy, since it is not only a valuable quality, but also a magic weapon to unite people. Last but not least, listen patiently and express properly.Without either, it is quite difficult to achieve effective communication with each other.

Nurturing harmonious interpersonal relationships is conducive to reducing stress, expanding interpersonal network, and enhancing team spirit. Therefore, it is well worth investing time and effort in cultivating and maintaining good interpersonal relationships on campus.

# 5.An Application for the Volunteer Teaching Program
Dear Sir or Madam,

As a freshman, I'm writing to apply for our school's volunteer teaching program in remote rural areas.

My reasons come as follows. Born and bred in the mountainous region of Yunnan Province, I, have received guidance and support, both financially and spiritually, from volunteer teachers since primary school. Therefore, I would cherish every opportunity to light up others' lives with my knowledge. Besides, I know so well about the hardship of life, hopes of parents, and the children's thirst for knowledge. I would take both professional teaching skills I have acquired in our university and the optimistic attitude towards life there. Finally, I have a very strong sense of responsibility and am willing to take supplementary roles, such as a school counselor and a food safety monitor. Such issues are of equal importance to teaching and learning with regards to the all-round development of kids.

I really appreciate your consideration and look forward to contributing to the teaching in remote rural areas.
Yours
